# Customer-Shopping-Behavior-Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on translating customer transaction data into business insights that can support marketing, pricing, and retention decisions. The analysis combines exploratory data work, SQL based logic, and dashboarding to answer real world business questions.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 3,900 customer purchases across multiple products and locations. It captures demographics, purchase value, discount usage, shipping preferences, and subscription status.

## Tools and Technologies

* Python with Pandas for data preparation and analysis
* MySQL Server for business driven SQL analysis
* Power BI for stakeholder friendly dashboards
* Gamma for executive level reporting

## Business Questions Addressed

* Which customer segments contribute most to revenue
* Do discounts increase volume without hurting spend
* How do subscribers differ from non subscribers
* Which products and categories drive performance
* Where are opportunities for customer retention and upsell

## Workflow

* Prepared and structured data using Pandas
* Used SQL to perform aggregations and segmentation logic
* Built a Power BI dashboard to track KPIs and trends
* Converted findings into clear business recommendations

## Dashboard

The dashboard provides a single view of customer behavior, revenue drivers, and product performance. It is designed for non technical stakeholders and quick decision making.

## Key Insights

* Loyal customers drive a majority of repeat revenue
* Subscription customers do not significantly outspend non subscribers, indicating room for value improvement
* Discounts increase engagement without reducing basket size
* Specific age groups and products contribute disproportionately to revenue

## How to Run

Run the notebook for analysis, use MySQL for queries, and open the Power BI dashboard for insights.
